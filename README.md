# Pixer (v0.9 pre-release, it does still have some bugs to fix)

[Click here to download latest version](https://github.com/RabidTunes/pixeltexturizer/releases/download/0.9/RabidPixelTexturizer-0.9.zip)

This is a Blender Addon that makes your textures' model âœ¨pixel perfectâœ¨

This means that if you apply a pixel art texture the pixels will be of a consistent size across your model.

# HOW TO INSTALL

Download the zip file and install it from preferences. <sub><sup>(I'm too lazy to explain this but it is the typical procedure just install it as any other addon)</sup></sub>

# HOW TO USE

- First make a 3D model!

- Switch to ortographic view and make sure all your vertices are aligned to the grid. You can press SHIFT + S -> snap to grid to do this.

- (OPTIONAL) If you feel that this snap to grid crunches your model, you can change the grid size (TODO ADD IMAGE WHERE TO CHANGE THIS) then snap to grid again

- Now go to Pixer addon panel on 3D view in edit mode and input the [number of pixels per 3D unit](https://github.com/RabidTunes/pixeltexturizer/blob/main/FAQ.md). It usually is 10 if you skipped the optional step, but this is the grid size if you modified it.

- Assign a squared texture to the model and input the texture size (must be a square texture)

- (Optional) Mark "Selection only" if you want to pixelize only selected faces. Otherwise, pixer will pixelize every face

- Press "Pixelize" button

It is very important that you adjust all the vertices to the grid (edit mode > enter ortographic view > press shift + S > selected to grid)
If vertices are not adjusted to the grid, I'm not sure what would happen, it probably might work anyways but I haven't tested what happens then ðŸ‘€
