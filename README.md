# Pixel Texturizer

This is a Blender Addon that makes your model âœ¨pixel perfectâœ¨

That means that if you apply a pixel art texture the pixels will be of a consistent size across your model.

# HOW TO USE

- Input the [number of pixels per 3D unit](https://github.com/RabidTunes/pixeltexturizer/blob/main/FAQ.md) (it usually is 10 if you haven't touched anything)

- Input the texture size (must be a square texture)

- (Optional) Mark "Selection only" if you want to pixelize only selected faces

- Press "Pixelize" button

For best results, you need to adjust all the vertices to the grid (edit mode > enter ortographic view > press shift + S > selected to grid)
If vertices are not adjusted to the grid, it will probably work anyways but I haven't tested what happens then ğŸ‘€
