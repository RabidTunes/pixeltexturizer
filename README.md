# Pixel Texturizer

This is a Blender Addon that makes your model "pixel perfect".

That means that if you apply a pixel art texture the pixels will be of a consistent size across your model.

For this plugin to work you need to adjust all the vertices to the grid (edit mode > enter ortographic view > press shift + S > selected to grid)

IMPORTANT NOTE: This addon only fixes the size of your UVs but it does not arrange your UVs in such a way that they are packed nicely.
For that, I recommend this other addon https://github.com/c30ra/uv-align-distribute which has an option to pack your UVs with a little separation and without applying rotation (after packing please select all your UVs and press shift + S > selected to pixels to align to pixels again)

Video explanation: TBD
